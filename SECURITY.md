# Security Policy for DigitalFuHub

Thank you for taking the time to help improve the security of **DigitalFuHub**. We take security seriously and welcome responsible disclosures of any security vulnerabilities that you may find.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security vulnerability in **DigitalFuHub**, we ask that you follow these steps to report it securely:

1. **Do not open an issue**: Please do not create public issues or pull requests to report a security vulnerability.
2. **Email us directly**: Send an email to [security@digitalfuhub.com] with a detailed description of the vulnerability, including:
    - A clear description of the vulnerability.
    - Steps to reproduce or proof of concept.
    - Any potential impact or severity.
3. **We will respond promptly**: After receiving your report, we will investigate the issue as quickly as possible and work with you to verify the issue and determine the best course of action.
4. **Please provide a timeframe**: If the issue has a specific time window for exploitation (e.g., tied to a specific release), please make us aware so we can prioritize the fix.

## Responsible Disclosure

We ask for your cooperation in following responsible disclosure practices. This means:

- Do not publicly disclose any vulnerabilities until we have had a chance to investigate and issue a patch, if needed.
- Give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before public disclosure (e.g., 30 days).

We will make every effort to acknowledge your contribution and keep you updated throughout the process.

## Security Best Practices

To ensure that our project is secure, we encourage contributors to follow best practices in secure coding, such as:

- **Input validation**: Ensure that all user inputs are properly sanitized and validated to prevent attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection.
- **Authentication and authorization**: Always use secure methods for authentication (e.g., OAuth, OpenID Connect) and never hard-code credentials.
- **Data encryption**: Sensitive data should always be encrypted both at rest and in transit. Use up-to-date encryption standards (e.g., AES-256, TLS 1.2+).
- **Regular updates**: Ensure that all dependencies are regularly checked for updates and vulnerabilities. Use tools like [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) or [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) to keep track of known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Security Updates

When a security vulnerability is disclosed and a patch is issued, we will:

- Provide a detailed changelog outlining the vulnerability and how it was mitigated.
- Release a new version of the project that addresses the vulnerability.
- Inform the community through the repositoryâ€™s security advisory or other relevant channels.
